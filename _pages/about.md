Hello! My name is Yongjia Deng (邓永嘉, she/her). 
I am a second-year PhD student from the [Language and Science Program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://langsci.wisc.edu), working with Professor [Jacee Cho](https://langsci.wisc.edu/staff/jacee-cho/). I completed my B.A. in Linguistics with distinction at Purdue University in 2024. Having grown up as a Hakka heritage speaker in southeastern China, I can speak Mandarin Chinese, Hakka, and a little Cantonese.

My research interests lie in are **psycholinguistics** and **Second Language Acquisition(SLA)**.
